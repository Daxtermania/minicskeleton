minicskeleton
=============

A module template for Prestashop v1.5.x.

This is a module template for Prestashop v1.5.x versions. Contains a basic markup to speed up module development.
The skeleton was created based on the latest <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Creating+a+PrestaShop+module" target="_blank">module creaton tutorial</a>.
Some things from the tutorial is skipped, some others are added, like the database manipulation, which I think is very usefull and easy to use.

Feel free to leave a comment on the <a href="" target="_blank">forum</a> or here on github. Any suggestion, bug, commit will be concidered!

Happy coding!
